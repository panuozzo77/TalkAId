# TalkAId
This project allows users to conduct remote speech therapy sessions and analyzes exercises through an Artificial Intelligence (AI) module. The system is based on web technologies. 

The main features are:
* Login page
   * If needed, you can request the reset of the password through the email you registered.    
* Registration page
   * DISCLAIMER: You need a valid license or a valid PIN invitation.   
* Patients have an homepage to chech the exercises to complete.
* Therapists can invite patients to their group.
* Therapists can assign medical conditions and exercises to do.
   * the type of exercises are: crosswords, read-text, images-to-text, read-images, choose-right-text, text-to-images
   * the system recommend exercises to do based on the medical condition of the patient [not done, yet].
* Therapists can view the points of each done exercise.
* Therapists can view the history points trend on a plot.
* Patients can view the points of each done exercise.
* Patients can submit a feedback after each exercise.
* Patients and their Therapists can message each other.
* Patients and Therapists have a "Notification" chat in which they'll get important news or reminder.
* Therapists can create and delete visiting hours for their medical appointments.
* Patients can book or unbook appointments with their speech therapist.

# Usage
1. You can log in using the email stored inside the database's table 'user'. All the passwords are "pwd".
2. Navigate inside the website.
3. Follow the instructions to perform the proposed exercise.
4. After completing the exercises, the system will use the Artificial Intelligence module to analyze performance.
5. View the analysis results for feedback and suggestions on your pronunciation and exercise execution.
